![Link Totk Banner](https://www.tomsguide.fr/content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg)

This mini project aims to expose datas from The Legend of Zelda : Tears of the Kingdom.
This aims to be useful for speed runners, or devs that might use it to create tools to enhance pathfinding for 100% speedruns for example.

I might implement an A* or something like that in the future, to explore different pathings.

### Installation

1. Pull datas from zeldamaps API.
    ```shell
    bin/pull.sh
    ```

2. Clean datas and sort in subfolders.
    ```shell
    bin/sort.sh
    ```

### Precisions

The data was pulled from Zelda Maps API, check out their maps at https://zeldamaps.com. I'm not affiliated with them.
